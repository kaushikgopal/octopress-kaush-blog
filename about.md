[Kaushik Gopal](http://kaush.co) writes this blog using Octopress 3.0 (which as of this writing, is still in beta).

i (re)designed the theme myself and it was heavily inspired by a bunch of other blogs and designs that i deeply respect.

[my company](https://www.weddingpartyapp.com/jobs) is nice enough to let me rant my technical thoughts on my [company blog](http://nerds.weddingpartyapp.com/authors/kaushik-gopal/). i like keeping the really technical (developer focused) posts there. there are however things that i feel strongly about (like movies, music and life) that doesn't really make sense on my company blog. for those I come here.

i don't do comments, mostly because i do a terrible job of keeping up with them. just tweet [@kaushikgopal](http://twitter.com/kaushikgopal) if you feel strongly enough about something that warrants my attention. i'm much better with my twitter replies.

*the constant lowercase is not a bug in the blog or a copy-review error. i generally write in lowercase because i have rsi problems and reserve the hand concoction for coding*.
