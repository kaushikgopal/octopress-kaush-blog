In case you had any doubts, [Kaushik Gopal](http://kaush.co) writes this blog.

This blog runs on Octopress 3.0. Octopress is awesome and is built with Ruby. Kaushik likes Ruby.

This theme is an original one and was (re)designed by myself.

I currently work at [Instacart](www.instacart.com) as a Senior Android developer and in the past have worked for a bunch of startups and big companies always working with computers and software. I'm also known in some circles of the internet for starting an Android Developer podcast called [Fragmented](http://fragmentedpodcast.com) with my co-host Donn Felker. We talk about building good software and becoming better Android developers on the podcast. Tune in every Monday if you're interested.

I write about the things I find interesting. These include but aren't limited to technology, software engineering, mobile development, design & type (I'm less skilled at these but am equally passionate), sound engineering (my primary job in an alternate life), movies (I watch a movie ritually every Friday). Sometimes I write detailed technical posts on [my company blog](https://tech.instacart.com/author/kg/) as well.

I don't do comments on this blog, mostly because I do a terrible job of keeping up with them. Just tweet [@kaushikgopal](http://twitter.com/kaushikgopal) if you feel strongly enough about something that warrants my attention. I'm much better with my tweet replies.

I'm known to never say no to a cup of coffee. If we're in the same area, I'd love to chat over a cup.
