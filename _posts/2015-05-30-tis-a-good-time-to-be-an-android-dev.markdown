I attended my very first [Google IO](https://events.google.com/io2015/) this year. Google put on a great show!

The 180-270%-ish screen setup at the keynote was spectacular (occasional weird acts aside - hello completely irrelevant giant whale). I also liked how they used the massive screen estate effectively during  the presentations. They alternated between live feeds of the presenter and slides which made it easy for the ones who didn't manage to snag a good seat at the keynote [^1]. When it was time to impress the audience with some of the cool VR-cardboard demos they switched to the massive panaromic views and impress they did!

The announcements were pertty rad: [Google Photos](https://www.google.com/photos/about/) is going to be a godsend (Gmail for your photos) , [Now on Tap](http://www.theverge.com/2015/5/28/8677147/google-now-on-tap-announced) (a.k.a Skynet 0.1) was scary awesome, the VR demos graduated from a dorky/nerdy cardboard project to making Oculus just skip a heartbeat (love what they're  doing with [Expeditions](https://www.google.com/edu/expeditions/)) and obvioulsy the [improvements with Android M](http://www.droid-life.com/2015/05/28/google-announces-android-m-developer-preview-here-is-a-list-of-changes/).

All this was cool and all but I would have been just as impressed watching the announcements from the comforts of my couch. What I personally found invaluable was the chance to meet some of the most amazing  developers in the world. If you haven't already heard I now co-host an Android developer podcast called [Fragmented](http://fragmentedpodcast.com) (if you're an Android developer you sould totally listen to us btw).

There's always room to complain. The lines were terribly long, the space management inside Moscone left a lot to wi. But as my good friend @yoghurtearl mentioned


 .This is an amazing time to be an android developer, not just because android is awesome;  but  the developer  community is probably rhe most friendliest, approachable and helpful ones you can ever find. There were so many other amazing developers  that i wanted to interview and who agreed, but this was my first io and I was a complete newb with my time and schedule management . But hopefully, we will get them all on the show. Thanks for listening and hope you enjoyed the episode
