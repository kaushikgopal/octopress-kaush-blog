People keep asking me where architecture I use or recommend or prefer. Here's the deal I don't have one specific one. I approach my daily development with radical pragmatism (I understand sometimes to a fault but oh well).

It's been hard for me to answer this question with justifiable detail. So this next series of posts should hope to answer that. 

I take concepts from architecture and try to apply them in my app. 



Nothing gets Android developers more excited than architecture talk.

In my years of development though, very rarely have I had the luxury of working on a green field app. As a software engineer, the fact is you don't get to create an app from scratch in the style of your glorious MV(X) blueprint. The life of a software engineer is such: you work with what you have and try to make it better.

I intend to break this post into two parts: 

In this post, I'd like to list down the concepts that have most inspired and convinced me of their value. Instead of recommending a specific blueprint or a particular architecture style, I'd like to jot down some of the concepts that have most convinced me of their value. 

I try to keep these in mind as i build any feature. The hope is what lands up happening is we arrive at a well architected feature (or portion of the app).

In part 2, we'll look at a live existing feature from the Instacart shopper app. I'll try to walk you through my thinking as I refactor this feature into one keeping these above concepts in mind.
