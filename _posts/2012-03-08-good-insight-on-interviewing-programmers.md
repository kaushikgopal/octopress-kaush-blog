If you're in the business of hiring programmers, the article linked is a must read. It's concise and a gold read. No excuse for not reading it.

+ Avoid nano-questions
+ A good engineer thinks abstractly in terms of designing and building systems, they think in terms of algorithms, components, and engineering design. They do not necessarily know all of the details of syntax of a given language, especially if they are used to a good IDE...
+ ... it is more important that I be able to tell you **when and where** I should use inheritance, and **when and where** I should use polymorphism, than to be able to **spit off the definition**. ((bolded text my own))
+ Basically: Any question that takes 5 seconds to answer with Google is not a good question. My favorite phone interview question? "What’s your favorite language?" followed by "What are it’s weaknesses?"
