Apple released [a new iPad ad](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDvweiW5ZKQ) during the Olympics. If you're curious to know which song they used, it's the song ["Driving" by Stolen Jars](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoCljFnXVGE).

Two other songs i picked from their previous ads:

[Goldengrove](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAzPYXEMLUM) &  [The Kiss](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqz3SBQfVBM).
