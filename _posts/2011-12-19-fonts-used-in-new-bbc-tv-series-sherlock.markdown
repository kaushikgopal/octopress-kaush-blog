So [my brother](http://www.karthickgopal.net/incredible-depth-in-the-mundane/) introduced me to this really awesome BBC TV Series: [Sherlock](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherlock_(TV_series)). If you're a [type nerd](http://ask.metafilter.com/162092/The-Case-of-the-Unknown-Font) or design enthusiast, the very first thing you would notice is the brilliant typography used throughout the show.

If you're losing sleep finding out which fonts were used:

**[AF Generation Z](http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/fw-acme/af-generation-z/) (in the text messages)**

**[P22 London Underground](http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/p22/underground/) (when deducing the clues)**
