title: My New Programming Font - IBM Plex Mono

I'm obsessed with typefaces and fonts [^1]. 

My programming productivity is irrationally dependent on the font I pick for my IDE. I have spent _unhealthy_ amounts of time experimenting and trying different fonts for programming.

I usually prefer a monospaced font and I've bounced between [Inconsolata](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inconsolata) and [Consolas](https://www.fonts.com/font/microsoft-corporation/consolas/regular) in the past – both truly beautiful typefaces. 

Recently though, a design director at Instacart shared this link on the [laws of UX](https://lawsofux.com/) (a fantastic read btw). 

But —hot damn— I was smitten after looking at that website. The font used there was **GORGEOUS**! I knew it was monospaced just from looking at it. I didn't get past the first law, without first finding out which font was being used.

Thus I stumbled upon my new programming font – IBM Plex Mono. I don't make a font change in my IDE that casually, without first putting it through the paces. 

I give it a glowing recommendation for your IDE. There's an interesting back story behind the making of the font on [Medium](https://medium.com/@Uxtrending/ibm-plex-a-typeface-and-a-story-e01b2e502aab) too.

Btw, just changing the font is not enough – you have to pick the right size and line spacing (I've found a size of 15 and line-spacing of 1.15 works best for me).

[^1]: Did you know – fonts and typefaces aren't [necessarily interchangeable](https://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/questions/12717/what-is-the-difference-between-a-font-and-a-typeface). You use "typeface" when you’d use "song" (e.g. "I love that song/typeface …"), and "font" when you’d use "track" ("… so I’m going to buy the track/font for it").
