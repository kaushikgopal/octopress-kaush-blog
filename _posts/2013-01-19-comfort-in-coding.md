There's something innately comforting about coding. The solution is not known but the variables are fixed. The ambiguities are minimal and the choices are simple. The rule book is adhered to. You mess up and you get bugs, you get it right and a solution is reached. If the solution is good, it becomes poetry.

I realize why management have it tough now. The jargon, documentation, definitions, ambiguity and interpretations that they have to deal with are such a mess.

*I write this as I power through a course where in order to take a break from it all, I resort to coding.*
