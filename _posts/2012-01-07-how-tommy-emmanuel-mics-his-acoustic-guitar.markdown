for his professional albums, he uses a combination of 4 mics as explained in [this youtube video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1KI8JQEzz4). the song he plays in the end is Mombasa, easily one of his best compositions.

on the move he records with an Apogee ONE as seen in [this youtube video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEHnMuq8F-0). for an on-the-move mic and sound capture device, the Apogee ONE is simply mind blowing.
