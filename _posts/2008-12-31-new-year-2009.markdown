It's New Year's Eve and I'm all set with my resolutions. Until I started seriously blogging (which-if you believe-would be around mid 2008), I never really saw the point in drawing up these lists. It felt lame, pointless and a waste of time. But with the advent of my blogging ways, I realize that maintaining a resolution-list would help keep check and achieve my goals/ambitions much faster. Besides, 365 days from now it will be nice to see how my priorities and views might have changed.

Brace yourself:

## Start Regularly Gymming again

In 2006-2007 I morphed from a whooping 100kg couch potato to a 70kg cardio-freak. From the start-mid 2008, I was diligent with my gymming and en-route to my distant dream 6-pack. Time to start putting up Arnold posters again.

## Read the gazillion books just bought

One of the many good habits my brother passed on to me, is a love for reading books. What the bugger also passed on was an insatiable need to purchase all the awesomest books around. 2008 gave us Reality Check, Outliers, Tribes, Presentation Zenâ€¦ all of which I already posses a copy of. This is apart from the many books I purchased in 2007 but never got the time to fully read.

## Get Sketching

I was at one point of time(sometime between the 7th and 9th grades) quite a decent artist. After my 10th (board exams), I completely left this and continued only to pursue my musical inclinations. I want to revive that lost interest and talent. Vector Graphics is also something I'm seriously looking at.

## Learn Arabic

I love learning languages. I've spent a major part of my life in the middle-east and it's a shame I haven't picked the language up yet. The fascinating thing about Arabic is that the script is really easy. I can in fact read and write Arabic pretty well. Each time I try to speak though, my *bakala* owner thinks I'm a retard.


There is no later, only now! It is my ardent belief that the number one productivity-killer is procrastination. I've fallen short of quite a few of my goals this year primarily for this reason. No more!

It's a modest list, one that currently seems doable. Time will tell...
