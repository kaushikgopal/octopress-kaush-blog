fantastic video, great stunts and carefully edited. must watch!

[Tempest Freerunning Academy](http://vimeo.com/22157500) from [The Cool Hunter](http://vimeo.com/thecoolhunter) on [Vimeo](http://vimeo.com).

i just love the super smooth background score in the video. it's a remix of the song Lights by Ellie Goulding and has become my favorite running tune. you can [download it for free here](http://www.bassnectar.net/2011/02/ellie-goulding-lights-bassnectar-remix/).
