when [Billy Joel was on the Jimmy Falon show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cU-eAzNp5Hw) and they used the [iPad app "Looper"](http://loopyapp.com/), i immediately looked for the android equivalent. there wasn't one. i'm an android developer and a sound engineer (enthusiast) so obviously the right thing to do, was build one...

i spent about two weeks and then gave up on the project cause it demanded far more time than i initially anticipated. the linked article is a [fantastic read and summary](http://superpowered.com/androidaudiopathlatency/) on the problems with audio latency in android (and why i eventually just gave up on that project).
