‪‪We need more kindness and positivity in our online lives today. There is no side, that cannot benefit from that. ‬

Being rational or correct is futile without empathy. 

You can have opposing (or even incorrect) views but you have to find a kind and positive way to express that. 

You either learn you're wrong or convince the other of your point of view. But everyone is more willing to have the conversation, if approached with kindness and positivity. 

A good first step for me is surrounding myself with kinder and positive people.
