I [finished 2014](http://blog.kaush.co/2014/12/31/new-year-2015/) not having the slightest clue what would be in store. 2015 was a rollercoaster:

I started a new podcast [Fragmented](http://fragmentedpodcast.com/about/) (with my cohost and now friend Donn Felker), bought my childhood dream car (a Mini Cooper), got a new job (Wedding Party was acquired by Instacart), visited NY for the first time (for a [talk](https://speakerdeck.com/kaushikgopal/painless-ui-testing) I gave at DroidCon NYC) and finally - this one really stumped me - moved to San Francisco.

The new year brings in a sea of sweeping change. With it I gain a little insight about myself and the world (yes, even the goofball that you see has been chiseled with each passing year). There were lows but we should focus on the highs.

Life is good, people can be amazing, let's surprise ourselves and here's to a peaceful and amazing 2016!
