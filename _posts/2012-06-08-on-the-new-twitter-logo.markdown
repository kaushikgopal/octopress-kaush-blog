Twitter's got a [new logo](http://blog.twitter.com/2012/06/taking-flight-twitterbird.html). It's [clean and simple](http://labs.upperdog.se/twitter-logo-in-css/). But here's a more astute observation from [underconsideration.com](http://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/twitter_gives_you_the_bird.php) :

> For the most part, all the news sources reporting on the revised bird have focused on its visual update, which I will get to soon, but the real story here is that Twitter has dropped its name from the logo. If you look at the opening image of this post, the change is quite drastic. And ballsy. Twitter has achieved in less than six years what Nike, Apple, and Target took decades to do: To be recognizable without a name, just an icon.
