I've read and watched a lot on Rx. Most examples either use the J8 lambda notations/Scala/Groovy or some other awesome language that us Android developers are constantly envious of.

Unfortunately I could never find real-world simple examples in Android that could show me how to use RxJava. To scratch that itch, I [created a github repo](https://github.com/kaushikgopal/Android-RxJava) with a couple of nifty examples using RxJava. You can build the apk and run the app to see different working examples.

If you don't know anything about RxJava, I would strongly recommend you first get acquainted with RxJava and understand the terminology really well. It has a pretty steep learning curve, so just throw yourself at it, until you start to understand the motivation behind its usage. Here are some resources to get you started:

1. [Rx in 15 minutes - by Erik Meijer](http://channel9.msdn.com/Blogs/Charles/Erik-Meijer-Rx-in-15-Minutes) creator of the Reactive extensions. RxJava is essentially a Java port of Reactive extensions.
2. [Rx Workshop - Channel9](http://channel9.msdn.com/Series/Rx-Workshop) Microsoft's video channel on RX. Just peruse through the first few videos. You'll pick a lot of useful info.
3. Watch this excellent [talk by Ben Christensen - one of the creators of RxJava](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Netflix-API-rxjava-hystrix/).
4. An interesting writeup I found [somewhere in the interwebs](https://gist.github.com/staltz/868e7e9bc2a7b8c1f754).
5. Dan Lew started a nice primer series today, on RxJava for Android. Definitely follow his [3 part series](http://blog.danlew.net/2014/09/15/grokking-rxjava-part-1/).
6. [Snoop around the RxJava wiki](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava/wiki). Look at those marble diagrams specifically. You will have to come back to them repeatedly to get a good understanding of the operators.

Once you have a decent understanding of when to use RxJava and the different terms used, come back to the [learning RxJava by example repo](https://github.com/kaushikgopal/Android-RxJava) and you'll find the examples a godsend. If not, [contribute](https://github.com/kaushikgopal/Android-RxJava#contributing) with the examples you think that will be.
