2009 was good. I didn't do to well in terms of fulfilling [my resolutions last year][1], but I've got a great feeling about 2010. Here's 2010's resolutions:

## Get my website/blog back up

I've been saying this for too long now. 2010 WILL see this task done. Period..

## Read one book a month

I sought to do something similar in 2009, instead I tweaked my rss feeds and lived like an information junkie. No regrets though. i've learned and gathered much more information than I would have reading just books. The problem though is that my attention span has dwindled to an alarming low. Going to take care of that.

## Get fit, get a Tattoo!

I recently watched the movie Avatar with my folks. Both my bro and I were fascinated with the movie and in particular, [Sam Worthington's tattoo](http://news.bme.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/screen-shot-2009-12-20-at-125942-am.png). My mom remarked, if you can get as fit as him, then i'll pick the tattoo for you. This was mind-blowing for me. You see my family is an extremely pious one, and the fact that my mom would even hint at the possibility of me getting a tattoo made me giddy with joy.. This isn't going to be done in a year. But I want that tattoo so bad :)



(Tried googling around for a pic of the tattoo, [this link](http://news.bme.com/2009/12/20/avatar-the-movie/) is the best I could come up with. )

**Happy New Year folks ! Here's wishing your 2010 is ten times more snappier and jolly than you hope it to be. What are you planning for this 2010?**
