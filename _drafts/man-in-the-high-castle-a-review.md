*I don't do spoilers. I'm not the scum of the earth that way. You can safely read this review knowing fully well that your experience for watching the show will remain untainted.*

In order to survive these days, TV shows have to cater to instant gratification. If they don't impress within 3 episodes, they get dropped. Here's the thing though: the best shows tend to catch steam only around the 4th episode mark. You cannot rush a good TV show. You *should* not rush it. Breaking Bad was a phenomenal show. It was definitely not rushed.

## Pacing:

Some would even argue that BB was *too* slow. Here's the problem though: if they rushed the show, chopped it up so it was a nice and tight 3 season show (instead of a "whooping" 5 season saga), you wouldn't have liked it. They took the time to build every single character; even the goons you would have otherwise through irrelevant were built up. But it's' important because then you could relate fully well with ever character and in the process relate fully well to the plot. You knew in your heart fully well if you liked the character or hated the character. That requires time.

A great TV show is basically a super long great movie chopped into episodes for asynchronous viewing. The beauty with TV shows, unlike movies, is that you (should) have the luxury of time. I don't read too many books but I understand that the books are usually better than their onscreen adaptations... precisely for this reason. So when a TV show is rushed it annoys me because it rarely can be great.

"The Man in the High Castle" is a great TV show. We're only through season 1 and it's been extended for another but you should definitely watch it.

## Title sequence:

Every part of the TV show is important. When you watch a TV show you should watch all these cues. As a music enthusiast, whenever I watch a new TV show, I watch the entire title sequence from the beginning*. Why? it informs you about the show and it's pace. If done well, it could potentially get you into the right mood for watching the show. You think they I'm trying to hard to read in to something that's not true? Listen to Song Exploder interview [Jeff Beal](http://songexploder.net/jeff-beal) and [Ramin Djawadi](http://songexploder.net/ramin-djawadi). Seriously it's super short, go listen! They talk about the opening scores for House of Cards and Game of Thrones. Yeah, I knew that would do the trick :).

I knew the premise for The Man in the High Castle beforehand (if the Japanese and Germans had won World War 2) so I was actually surprised by the opening score. I expected a stern, daunting, loud almost military-like theme. Instead it's the complete opposite: gentle, soft, "blooming" song rendered by a beautifully soft voice. They want you to settle in, put your thinking cap on, imagine a totally different world with a 180 context shift. But there's also a tinch of morbidity and sadness to the song, much like the future they're trying to portray in the show. Also please don't mistake my saying this as an indication that the show is slow or boring. In fact, the ending of every episode leaves you with a cliffhanger* so it's definitely very gripping.

The visuals are extremely informative to the premise as well.



a great TV show is basically a super long running movie.

background score - how it influences the show.



Frank Underwood - great character.

camera shots, how it comes to focus. Main in the high castle s01e06.

music - slams door and it changes to quietness

classy - shows the brash ruthless dirty world in a classy manner. you know what they're trying to say without actually saying it, and in a classy way.

tensions rise the camera becomes more shaky.

you can do a lot with a plot. but truly for a fantastic show, you need characters.


plot: they make it believable. human beings have a sense of warping current circumstances to be real. they do that beautifully here.


I watch a lot of TV (a lot of movies too) and "Man in the High Castle" is a show I feel that's been. It checks all those marks.


scared they might pull a LOST and not really explain who the man in the high castle is. Taht would really piss me off.

Kudos to Amazon originals for allowing this TV show to take it's time and develop into what can be a truly amazing TV show.



* Some gems i've noticed along the way: Ever notice that every season of "The Wire" starts with the exact same song but sung by an entirely different artist? I like to think with each new season, they progressed with the times both in the show and in real life.
* a ploy I'm personally not a big fan of but that's a proven way of leaving the public yearning for more. A necessary element for the extended life of a TV show. I prefer they present the outcome in a way that doesn't give you all the information. That way I have to ponder more, filling in the gaps.
