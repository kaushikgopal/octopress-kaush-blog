> Couldn’t agree with @peterwells more, Android camera’s are finally great, and have pulled ahead of the iPhone: http://www.smh.com.au/digital-life/mobiles/this-is-the-year-of-the-android-camera-20150715-gicgbn

You should read the whole conversation to understand the context but I had a couple of thoughts. I began typing up a response to Rusty, but after Tweet 4/5 I realized this is better flushed out in a post.

1. Android Cameras are finally great

I honestly don't believe so. The Samsung S6 is the first phone that takes truly amazing pictures (and in Rusty's defense he does mention that in a response) but every other phone has a long way to go. The LG G4 has been getting great reviews, but we'll have to wait 


The S6 camera is the first camera on the phone that's amazing in the Android world.

The article makes a suggestion that Sony cause it makes the same amazing camera for everyone is going to have a killer one for itself. Couldn't disagree more.

The manufacturer specific driver software is REALLY important. Hate Samsung all you want theyve gotten this part of the equation down right.

See OnePlus2 Reddit thread. They say themselves they have the same amazing camera but hope it lives up. (It's better than old gen but not close to S6 apparently)

And now we talk about the reigning king - the iPhone 6. Russel and the linked article say andoird has pulled ahead. I don't agree. We have one camera out in market that seems to be on par, and slightly better (according to some reviews out there).

I've been a strong supporter of both camps. So I'm biased to both platform's. But I know what I know from my phone usage.
